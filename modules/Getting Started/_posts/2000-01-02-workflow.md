The Data Analysis Workflow
==========================

We begin by looking at the Data Analysis workflow. The version above is
a concept created by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) and Adapted
from [Bradley Boehmke](http://bradleyboehmke.github.io/).

The diagram shows the natural flow of how we work with data and perform
research. We will begin to explore what this means as we continue.

Data Wrangling
==============

The first steps we take in any Data Analysis is Data Wrangling. Before
we can do any kind of analysis we need to be able to collect our data.
Sometimes this comes in from one source but many times this comes from
multiple data sources.

Once we have this data we find that very rarely is it ever in a useful
form. In fact [Dasau and
Johnson](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471268518.html)
suggest that this data preparation of cleaning may take up to 80% of the
time.

This is where R has great power and by the end of this course you will
be able to work with multiple data sources and wrangle data like a pro.

Importing Data
--------------

When it comes to importing your data R is very powerful. R can grab data
from many courses including

-   .csv, .txt. .xls, ....
-   SPSS, SAS, Stata
-   Web Scraping
-   Databases
    -   MySQL
    -   Oracle
    -   PostgreSQL
    -   MongoDB

Tidying Data
------------

Tidying Data is the process in making data useful. In this concept we
have ecah column of data represent a variable and each row of data
represents a single observation. This format is quite useful for data
analysis. In this course we will rely heavily on the `tidyr` package.

Transforming Data
-----------------

Once we have data into R and begin to tidy the data we usually need to
transform multiple aspects of the data. R has many tools that allow a
user to manipulate and transform data.

Data Exploration and Analysis
=============================

R is one of the most capable languages to explore and analyze data. With
over 10,000 packages it can be hard to find models or plots that do not
already have multiple functions in R.

Visualizing Data
----------------

There are multiple ways to vizualize data in R. The base graphics are
easy to use and outperform Stata, SAS and SPSS. In this course we will
focus on using the [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) package. This package
is actually a language for grahpics and once a user becomes proficient
you can create grahs like the one shown below which is created by
[Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social
Science](http://www.iq.harvard.edu/event/introduction-r-graphics-ggplot2-0).
The original plot came from the economist:

Then below can be created by ggplot without any outside graphics
software.

Modeling Data
-------------

Once data has been vizualized it is important to model the data. R can
handle anything from a simple t-test to the working with data that is
overa terrabyte in size.

Data Collaboration and Publishing
=================================

In every field it is key to be able to communicate what we learn and
publish this work so that it can be beneficial to others. It is also
important that statisticians can collaborate with others as well.
Rstudio provides many tools to do these things:

-   `RStudio` connects easily to:
    -   [Github](https://www.github.com/)
    -   [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/)
    -   [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/)
-   `shiny` provides an interactive data visualization and java
    script environment.
-   `plotly` allows for interactive graphics for webpages.
-   `RStudio` can make webpages, books, slides, and many other documents
    that can help relay data. (In fact this course was entirely built in
    RStudio using Github).
