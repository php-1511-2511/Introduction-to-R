About This Course
========================

This is a short module to discuss the layout of this course. You will encounter quite a few different pieces in this course and we will introduce them here. 

What to Expect
----------------------

The goal of this course is to give you a guided introduction to R. In its current state there are no videos for the lessons but they do have more of a conversational tone than many other online resources. If you come back in the future there will also be videos for each lesson. 

This brief course will help to prepare you for the start of the [NAMBARI Biostatistics Course: Introduction to R Programming for Biostatistics Data Management, Regression Modeling and Survival Analysis](https://nambari.github.io/).
